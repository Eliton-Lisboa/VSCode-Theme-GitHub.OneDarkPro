# VSCode Theme GitHub + OneDarkPro
 
I really liked the Design that the GitHub theme gives to VSCode but  
the code is a little colorless, so I had the idea of joining the  
GitHub and OneDarkPro theme, which for me is one of the best has  
a color term.

How to use:  
Windows:  

    - Copy the folder to the /Users/{your microsoft user}/.Vscode/extensions
    - Open the VSCode
    - Click {File}
    - Click on {Preferences}
    - Click on {Color Theme}
    - Select {GitHub Dark}
